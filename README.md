# Smart-Lamp
Lighting is an essential part of day to day life as it provides safety in manufacturing facilities as well as security at home and business. However, lighting consumes over 200 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually in the United States and negatively impacts human and animal health. To alleviate these problems, we developed a luminance controlled light which measures the brightness of the room which a light is in and controls the brightness of the light. In order to achieve these tasks, we utilized two devices to determine the power level of the light: a real time clock (RTC), a photoresistor and local weather. The purpose of the RTC is to allow the user to set desired times at which the lights turn on and off. Meanwhile, the photoresistor connected to an arduino, would measure the brightness of the room and would adjust the light’s brightness accordingly. Additionally, the weather station API is used to collect hourly weather data to modify light’s brightness as well. All of the data is aggregated to the Raspberry Pi which controls the logic of the smart lamp.
